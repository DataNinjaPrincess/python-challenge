# python-challenge
This week's homework encompasses two separate challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. 

The first is PyBank, in which the file "budget_data.csv" is read and analyzed.  This file can be found in the Resources folder, and the Analysis folder contains a text file, “FinacialSummary.txt” which contains the final summary data.  This information is also printed to the screen when the script is run. 

PyPoll, analyzes the data in the file “election_data.csv”, which at over 3 million lines is too large to use another method such as Excel.  It creates the file “ElectionResults.txt” in the Analysis folder, which contains a summary of total votes, percentage and count of votes cast per candidate, and declares the winner.
